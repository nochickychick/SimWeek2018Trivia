    <h2> Question Fifteen: Scaffolding is a teaching methodology.</h2>
    <p> <img src="Photos/q15g.png" alt="stats for question 15"> </p>
<br>
<p> Possible answers:</p>
    
   <ul>
       <li>True</li>
       <li>False</li>
    </ul>

<p> correct answer: <strong> True </strong></p>

<h3>Rationale:</h3>
    <p>Scaffolding is an instructional methodology. Overtime, this is another term that has morphed and take on another life somewhat divergent from its original meaning. </p>
    <h4>What is instructional scaffolding?</h4>
    <p>Scaffolding is an instructional methodology that is derived from Vygotsky's theories of learning, especially the Zone of Proximal Development. The term itself was coined by Dr. Jerome Bruner in his studies using Vygotsky's principles. 
    </p>
    <p>It is an active, not a passive, term--refering to the methods and actions an instructor takes to support a student's learning. In the beginning, when the student has less understanding and/or confidence, a teacher will need to provide more support. Over the course of learning, much like building scaffolding as a project runs from foundation to completion, the instructor first builds their support, and then withdrawls their support gradually as a student becomes more confident and more capable with the material. In pedagogical terms, this is called 'release of responsibility' in the classroom.</p>
    <h4>How did it become a reference to content?</h4>
    <p> Most likely, this is due to the example of scaffolding where teachers connect prior learning to current course work in a task called 'building on prior knowledge'. This task requires one to have knowledge of connecting content, and in a programatic context would highlight the need to 'build content in a systematic manner' through out a program.</p>
    <h4>Examples of Scaffolding:</h4>

    </p>
    <p>Scaffolding has been shown to be an effective teaching method, but only if the instructor is aware of the level of learners and their Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD).
