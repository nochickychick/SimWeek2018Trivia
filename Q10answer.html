<h1 align="center;">Answers and rationales for the Sim Week 2018 Trivia Quiz</h1>
    <h2> Question Ten: If an assignment has a high point value, it is high stakes.  </h2>
    <p> Enter the stats for the question here </p>
    <br>
<p> Possible answers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>True</li>
    <li>False</li>
    </ul>
<p> correct answer: <strong> False </strong></p>

<h3>Rationale:</h3>
    <p>
        This one is a little bit of a trick question. High and Low stakes doesn't actually have anything to do with the test design itself. This is one that many people don't realize, because the meaning of the terms over time has travelled far from their original definitions. 
       <br>
        <blockquote> High Stakes vs. Low Stakes <br>
A “low-stakes test” would be used to measure academic achievement, identify learning problems, or inform instructional adjustments, among other purposes. What distinguishes a high-stakes test from a low-stakes test is not its form (how the test is designed) but its function (how the results are used). For example, if test results are used to determine an important outcome, such as whether a student receives a high school diploma, the test would be considered a high-stakes test regardless of whether it’s a multiple-choice exam, an oral exam, or an essay exam. Low-stakes tests generally carry no significant or public consequences—the results typically matter far more to an individual teacher or student than to anyone else—and scores are not used to burnish or tarnish the reputation of teachers or schools.(edglossary.org)</blockquote>
        
        So, in education, the 'stakes' refer to the results of some sort of evaluation and what you do with them. Not the evaluation itself. So 'high stakes' refers to an evaluation where the result of the evaluation will result in a change in a student's path. We often call these "gatekeepers". Meet the metric on a high stakes exam, and you continue on your path. Fail to meet it, and you might find yourself denied advancement on the path or sent back to a previous point on the path. Low stakes activities do not serve as gatekeepers. Failure to meet the metric on these will not derail your progress on a path outright. You can often fail to meet the metric of a low stakes measure and still continue on a given path. <br>
        
        This can be kinda hard to wrap your head around at first...Let's look at an examples. <br>
In the first year of medical school, you will likely take a physical examination skills OSCE in a simulation center as part of a clinical skills course. Successful completion of this course is required to move on to the second year. To pass the course, you are told you must get at least an 80 in the course, AND at least an 80 on the OSCE. You score a 78.9 on the OSCE, and end up with a final grade in the course of an 85. Mathematically, you receive a passing grade in the course, but fail the course overall, because you did not meet the metric of the OSCE, which is a high stakes (gatekeeping) exam. You will not continue forward in the program and will retake the first year. <br>
        In the example, the result of the evaluation acted as a 'gate', and ended up in a determination/decision that affected the student's progress in the program.  <br>
    What you have to watch out for, is that you don't inadvertantly create an assessment or evaluation whose function is actually inline with that of a low stakes assessment, but in the way that it is design it starts to function more like a defacto high stakes evaluation.
