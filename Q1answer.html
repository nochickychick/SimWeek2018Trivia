<h1 align="center;">Answers and rationales for the Sim Week 2018 Trivia Quiz</h1>
    <h2> Question One </h2>
    <p> Enter the stats for the question here </p>
<p>What year did medicine begin using simulation as a teaching method?</p>
<h3> Possible answers: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2000 BC</li>
        <li>1964</li>
        <li>1985</li>
    </ul>

<p> correct answer: 2000 BC </p>
<h3>Rationale:________</h3>
    
<p> <strong>For those who chose 1964: </strong> There were developments in the early 1960s regarding the use of simulation in medical schools. Dr. Harold Barrows, who developed the first SP program in the U.S, has been credited with the first uses of simulated patients in MedEd. He was heavily involved in the develpment of performance-based testing for clinical skills and problem based learning (PBL). Additionally, Dr. Paula Stillman expanded this concept and developed the first standardized rating scale for feedback in early 1970s, the Arizona Clinical Interviewing Rating Scle (ACIR), which is still used today.</p>  </p>
    <p><strong>For those who chose 1985:  </strong> In the mid 80s, several demonstration conferences were put on to expand SP curriculum development and support in American medical curriculum, and several US-based residency programs began using SPs to test their students. In the US, foreign medical graduates have used SP-based clinical examinations since the late 90s, and American medical school students have had to take a universally required 12-station SP skills test since 2005. </strong>
