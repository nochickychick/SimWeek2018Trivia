    <h2> Question Eleven:A summative test is always high stakes </h2>
    <p> img src="Photos/q11g.png" alt="stats for question eleven" </p>
<br>
<p> Possible answers: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>True</li>
        <li>False</li>
    </ul>

<p> correct answer: <strong> False </strong></p>

<h3>Rationale:</h3>
    <p> Annndddd... we are back to how high/low stakes are defined. (See <a href="https://github.com/nochickychick/SimWeek2018Trivia/edit/master/Q10answer.html" target="_blank">Question 10</a> for more info if you haven't already.)<br>
        Over time, high stakes has become indistinguishable from summative and low stakes from formative, but that is not technically the case. You can have a summative test that is not high stakes. An end of chapter test is an example of summative testing that is not high stakes. However, in most situations, when you see high stakes testing, it is often a form of summative testing. <Br>
        When I think if summative testing, I think testing that occurs after the learner has been given all of the instruction, chances to practice the content, and feedback on their performance. With summative, the expectation is that the learner will have the ability to score high and perform well, because all of the instructional content has been provided prior to the test and they have had a chance to really learn the material. Because of this, at the point of summative assessment we are evaluating what they have learned; their level of academic achievement. Summative assessments are assessments <i> of learning </i><br>
        In formative assessment, or assessment <i> "for learning" <i> as it is sometimes called, the learner is still in the midst of instruction, and receiving feedback so that they can improve their performance. This is important, because formative assessment can help instructors to provide more support or instruction while it is happening to increase student success. Because the learning is still occuring, the expectation is that students may not perform with high scores and understanding that we often see in summative assessment. 
        
        *Because the concept of high/low stakes is result driven, you could <i> technically <i> have a formative assessment that is high stakes, although that truely defeats the purpose of formative assessment. <br>
